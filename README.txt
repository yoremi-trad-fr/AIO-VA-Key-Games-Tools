New project draft
This project is based on the observation that there are currently three main open source tools for decompiling/recompiling Key/VA game files.
LuckSystem/ Siglus / Rldev

The idea is to combine these three pieces of software into a single GUI, coded in Go and open source.
The versions of these software programmes are: 
-LuckSystem 2.3.2-Fork-Yoremi
-Siglus Tools 0.61
-Rldev- fork 2026

Lucksystem is already coded in Go and has a GUI (wrapper), which will serve as the basis for the project. I have started porting Siglus, and Rldev, which is natively coded in Ocaml, remains. I have started porting Siglus, and Rldev, which is natively coded in Ocaml, remains.
